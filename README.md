Mod Menu is optional, but required for configuring the whitelist. By default, only music by C418 is allowed. The feature can be enabled in the sound options.

'Mute Copyrighted Audio' creates a whitelist so that players can only play music that they have approved. This could be useful for content creators who worry about the possibility that their videos may be copyright striked.

I cannot, and will not guarantee that it will prevent anyones content using copyrighted audio from being copyright claimed. I will not be creating Forge/Quilt editions, and will not be adding languages besides English.

I hereby grant permission to do whatever you want with 'Mute Copyrighted Audio'.
